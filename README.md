## Ping Pong Score Counter

The Ping Pong Score Counter project is designed to facilitate scoring during ping pong matches. Each player has a button on their side of the table, which they can press to increment their score. 
These buttons are connected to a microcontroller, which is in turn connected to a computer where the scores and the number of serves are displayed.

How does it works

If a player scores a point, pressing the button will prompt the computer to emit a sound confirming the button press. 
Holding the button will retract the point addition in case of an error.


## Used Technologies
- python and tkinter library to show score
- raspberry pi pico with micro python
